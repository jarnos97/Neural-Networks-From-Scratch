# Neural Networks From Scratch

This repository presents a base Python (and NumPy) Deep Learning code base, created from scratch.
It consists of a main part, based upon the wonderful eponymous book, which can be found [here](https://nnfs.io/ "NNFS"). 
Furthermore, some personal additions were made, such as a Graph Convolutional Neural Network implementation.
The aim of this personal project was to gain deeper understanding of the inner workings of Neural Networks.
