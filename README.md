# Neural Networks From Scratch

This repository present the code implementation of a neural network in Python. 
Credits go to the authors of the wonderful eponymous book, which can be found [here](https://nnfs.io/ "NNFS").
The aim of this personal project was to gain deeper understanding of the inner workings of Neural Networks.
